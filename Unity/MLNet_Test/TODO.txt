        -save only relevant infos (remove y)
        -save only frames with movement
        -save xml in an extra thread
        -add movement weight (was it good or bad)
        -add angle to target
    -add simple UI (stats and things)
    -log movement every half a second or every time a key is pressed (with timestamp)
